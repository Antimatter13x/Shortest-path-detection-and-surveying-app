The screen recording shown here has slight discrepancies in soil prediction.
However this can be improved by adding image stabilisation before splitting up the video into its component frames
Also, note than small differenes won't matter much as we will take only the prediction that has been shown the most number of times to enter into the db/spreadsheet
